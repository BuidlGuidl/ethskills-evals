# UsdtYieldVault

Pooled USDT vault that routes deposits into Aave V3 and tracks depositor
ownership with internal shares.

Deposits and withdrawals each carry a fee in basis points. Both fees stay
supplied in Aave and accrue to the remaining shareholders — they are not swept
to the owner.

Mainnet targets:
