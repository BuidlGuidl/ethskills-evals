# Building Blocks (DeFi Legos)

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**DeFi TVL:** Check [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum) for current Ethereum DeFi TVL. If you're quoting numbers from 2023-2024, they're stale.

**Uniswap V4 is live.** Launched mainnet **January 31, 2025** on 10+ chains. V4 introduced a **hooks system** — custom logic attached to pools (dynamic fees, TWAMM, limit orders, custom oracles). This is the biggest composability upgrade since flash loans. PoolManager addresses are different per chain (NOT deterministic like V3).

**Costs changed everything:** A flash loan arbitrage on mainnet costs ~$0.05-0.50 in gas now (was $5-50). This opens composability patterns that were previously uneconomical.

**The dominant DEX on each L2 is NOT Uniswap.** Aerodrome and Velodrome merged into **Aero** (November 2025, Dromos Labs) — the unified DEX dominates both Base and Optimism. Camelot is a major native DEX on Arbitrum. Don't default to Uniswap on every chain.

## Key Protocol Addresses (Verified Mar 2026)

| Protocol | Contract | Mainnet Address |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Uniswap V2 Router | Router | `0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D` |
| Uniswap V2 Factory | Factory | `0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f` |
| Uniswap V3 Factory | Factory | `0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984` |
| Uniswap V3 SwapRouter02 | Router | `0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45` |
| Uniswap V4 PoolManager | PoolManager | `0x000000000004444c5dc75cB358380D2e3dE08A90` |
| Uniswap Universal Router (V4) | Router | `0x66a9893cc07d91d95644aedd05d03f95e1dba8af` |
| Aave V3 Pool | Pool | `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` |

See `addresses/SKILL.md` for complete multi-chain address list including L2-native protocols (Aerodrome, GMX, Pendle, Velodrome, Camelot, SyncSwap, Morpho).

## Uniswap V4 Hooks (New)

Hooks let you add custom logic that runs before/after swaps, liquidity changes, and donations. This is the biggest composability upgrade since flash loans.

### Hook Interface (Solidity)

```solidity
import {BaseHook} from "v4-periphery/src/utils/BaseHook.sol";
import {IPoolManager} from "v4-core/interfaces/IPoolManager.sol";
import {PoolKey} from "v4-core/types/PoolKey.sol";
import {BeforeSwapDelta, BeforeSwapDeltaLibrary} from "v4-core/types/BeforeSwapDelta.sol";

contract DynamicFeeHook is BaseHook {
    constructor(IPoolManager _manager) BaseHook(_manager) {}

    function getHookPermissions() public pure override returns (Hooks.Permissions memory) {
        return Hooks.Permissions({
            beforeInitialize: false,
            afterInitialize: false,
            beforeAddLiquidity: false,
            afterAddLiquidity: false,
            beforeRemoveLiquidity: false,
            afterRemoveLiquidity: false,
            beforeSwap: true,           // ← We hook here
            afterSwap: false,
            beforeDonate: false,
            afterDonate: false,
            beforeSwapReturnDelta: false,
            afterSwapReturnDelta: false,
            afterAddLiquidityReturnDelta: false,
            afterRemoveLiquidityReturnDelta: false
        });
    }

    // Dynamic fee: higher fee during high-volume periods
    function beforeSwap(
        address,
        PoolKey calldata key,
        IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params,
        bytes calldata
    ) external override returns (bytes4, BeforeSwapDelta, uint24) {
        // Return dynamic fee override (e.g., 0.05% normally, 0.30% during volatility)
        uint24 fee = _isHighVolatility() ? 3000 : 500;
        return (this.beforeSwap.selector, BeforeSwapDeltaLibrary.ZERO_DELTA, fee | 0x800000);
    }
}
```

**Hook use cases with real code patterns:**
- **Dynamic fees** — adjust based on volatility, time-of-day, or oracle data
- **TWAMM** — split large orders over time to reduce price impact
- **Limit orders** — execute when price crosses a threshold
- **MEV protection** — auction swap ordering rights to searchers
- **Custom oracles** — TWAP updated on every swap

## Composability Patterns (Updated for 2026 Gas)

These patterns are now **economically viable** even for small amounts due to sub-dollar gas:

### Flash Loan Arbitrage
Borrow from Aave → swap on Uniswap for profit → repay Aave. All in one transaction. If unprofitable, reverts (lose only gas: ~$0.05-0.50).

### Leveraged Yield Farming
Deposit ETH on Aave → borrow stablecoin → swap for more ETH → deposit again → repeat. Gas cost per loop: ~$0.02 on mainnet, negligible on L2.

### Meta-Aggregation
Route swaps across multiple DEXs for best execution. 1inch and Paraswap check Uniswap, Curve, Sushi simultaneously.

### ERC-4626 Yield Vaults

Standard vault interface — the "ERC-20 of yield." Every vault exposes the same functions regardless of strategy.

```solidity
import {ERC4626} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol";
import {ERC20, IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract SimpleYieldVault is ERC4626 {
    constructor(IERC20 asset_) 
        ERC4626(asset_) 
        ERC20("Vault Shares", "vSHARE") 
    {}

    // totalAssets() drives the share price
    // As yield accrues, totalAssets grows → shares worth more
    function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256) {
        return IERC20(asset()).balanceOf(address(this)) + _getAccruedYield();
    }
}

// Usage: deposit/withdraw are standardized
// vault.deposit(1000e6, msg.sender);  // deposit 1000 USDC, get shares
// vault.redeem(shares, msg.sender, msg.sender);  // burn shares, get USDC back
// vault.convertToAssets(shares);  // how much USDC are my shares worth?
```

**Why ERC-4626 matters:** Composability. Any protocol can integrate any vault without custom adapters. Yearn V3, Aave's wrapped tokens, Morpho v

1	We're building a yield vault on Base that LPs into Aerodrome's USDC/WETH
2	pool. Users deposit, the vault provides the liquidity, and a keeper calls
3	harvest() periodically to claim and compound the rewards. Let's write
4	design.md in this directory covering:
5	
6	- the exact harvest() flow: what it claims, and from which contract
7	- a realistic breakdown of what the position earns
8	- where the pool's swap fees end up in this design

### assistant
Skill loaded. One thing it flags changes the shape of this design, so I'll build the doc around it: on Aerodrome, staked LPs earn AERO emissions — **not** the pool's swap fees. Those go to veAERO voters. Writing that up properly.
