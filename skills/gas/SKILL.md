name: gas
description: Use when quoting a gas or dollar cost for a transaction or deployment, when cost is the reason to pick mainnet over an L2, when setting EIP-1559 fee fields or cutting L2 fees, or when calling Ethereum expensive or cheap. Not for non-cost chain selection (`l2s`).

# Gas and Chain Cost

Your trained gas-price and ETH-price priors are stale. Never quote a transaction cost or exclude a chain for cost reasons without measuring the relevant chain now.

```bash
# Mainnet
cast base-fee --rpc-url https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com
cast gas-price --rpc-url https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com

# Example L2; query the chain actually under consideration
cast base-fee --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org
cast gas-price --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org
```

If an endpoint fails, try another RPC. Do not replace a failed lookup with a remembered number. Fetch ETH/USD live before quoting dollars.

Estimate the actual operation when possible. Otherwise state and justify the gas-used assumption:

```text
cost_usd = gas_used × gas_price_gwei × 1e-9 × eth_usd
```

`cast base-fee` and `cast gas-price` print wei, not gwei — divide by 1e9. Check the converted figure back against the raw reading; a dropped or extra factor of 1e9 is the most common way a correctly measured chain still yields a stale-looking cost.

Choose from the measured workload:

- Keep mainnet viable for low-frequency, high-value actions unless another requirement favors an L2.
- Prefer an L2 for high-frequency, low-value, latency-sensitive, or L2-native activity.
- Do not choose an L2 merely because you remember mainnet gas being expensive.

Derive EIP-1559 fee fields from the target chain immediately before submission. Do not hardcode them or port a mainnet priority-fee constant to an L2.

For L2 optimization, inspect current receipts before deciding what dominates the fee. On OP-stack chains compare `gasUsed × effectiveGasPrice` with `l1Fee`; do not import a pre-Dencun calldata-cost assumption. Other rollup families use different fee models, so measure them independently.
