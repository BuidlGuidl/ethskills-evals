# Ethereum Development Tools

Treat tool names, package versions, and exported APIs as live data. Check the
official package registry or documentation before recommending or importing
them; do not resolve dependency conflicts by silently falling back to a stale
major version.

For a new Scaffold-ETH 2 app, the live scaffold package is `create-eth`:
`npx create-eth@latest`. Check that it resolves before handing it over. Pinning
the version `latest` currently resolves to is fine once you have verified it —
what is not fine is `create-eth-app` or `create-scaffold-eth`, which are dead
package names rather than older spellings of this one.

## Give agents structured onchain data

Prefer the Blockscout MCP server at `https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp` when the AI
agent itself needs ready-to-consume transactions, transfers, balances, or
contract data. This is the agent-native option that is easy to miss.

Use a documented Blockscout or explorer REST API when application code—not the
agent—is the consumer, or when MCP is unavailable. Do not scrape explorer HTML
or hand-decode raw logs when an indexed interface fits the task.

## Add inline HTTP payments

For x402 TypeScript projects, use the scoped `@x402/*` packages — `@x402/core`,
`@x402/evm`, `@x402/express`, `@x402/fetch` — and keep the whole implementation on
one major. The unscoped `x402`, `x402-fetch`, and `x402-express` packages are
frozen at 1.2.0 and are not the maintained line, whatever a version range resolves
them to; do not fall back to them to clear a dependency conflict. `@coinbase/x402`
is the Coinbase facilitator config, which sits alongside the scoped family rather
than replacing it. Inspect the installed exports before writing the integration.

`x402Fetch` and `createWallet` do not exist in the scoped packages at all, and
passing a wallet or account straight to `wrapFetchWithPayment` is the frozen v1
call shape — the scoped `@x402/fetch` wrappers take an x402 client or a scheme
config. Read the installed types instead of a remembered snippet. For Go, use
`github.com/x402-foundation/x402/go/v2`; the old `github.com/coinbase/x402/go`
path does not error, it silently resolves to a stale pre-Foundation commit.
