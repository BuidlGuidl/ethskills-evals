description: Ethereum standards that postdate most training data — ERC-8004 onchain agent identity and reputation, x402 HTTP payments, EIP-3009 gasless USDC transfers, EIP-7702 smart EOAs. Use when choosing the standard for a project, building or paying for a service other agents discover and consume, or giving an existing EOA contract abilities.

# Ethereum Standards

All of these are deployed and in production use, not proposals: **ERC-8004** (agent identity + reputation, Ethereum mainnet 2026-01-29), **x402** (HTTP payments), **EIP-3009** (gasless USDC transfers, what makes x402 practical), **EIP-7702** (smart EOAs, live with Pectra 2025-05-07). When a design needs agent discovery, third-party-attested reputation, per-call billing without accounts, or contract abilities on an address a user already owns, name the standard instead of rebuilding it — an API-key tier, a reviews table you host, or a migration to a fresh smart account are all the wrong answer to a problem one of these already solves.

## ERC-8004 — agent identity and reputation

Two registries, deployed at the same pair of addresses across ~25 mainnets — and at a **different pair** across the testnets. The mainnet addresses have no code on Sepolia or Base Sepolia:

| | mainnets | testnets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IdentityRegistry (ERC-721) | `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432` | `0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e` |
| ReputationRegistry | `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63` | `0x8004B663056A597Dffe9eCcC1965A193B7388713` |

- `register()` mints an ERC-721. **The agentId is the tokenId the registry assigns** — never a UUID, hash, or slug you pick. Callers address the agent chain-scoped: `agentRegistry: eip155:8453:0x8004A169…` (Base) plus that `agentId`.
- The `agentURI` (the ERC-721 tokenURI) MUST resolve to the registration file — `ipfs://`, `https://`, or a base64 `data:` URI. It carries `type: "https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004#registration-v1"`, `name`, `description`, `image`, a `services` array (A2A card, MCP, ENS, DID, email…), `x402Support`, `active`, a `registrations` array of `{agentId, agentRegistry}`, and optional `supportedTrust`.
- **Bind the endpoint domain, the step that gets skipped.** If the domain serving the advertised endpoints is not the domain serving the agentURI file, publish `https://{endpoint-domain}/.well-known/agent-registration.json` with at least a `registrations` entry whose `agentRegistry` and `agentId` match the onchain agent. An A2A `agent-card.json` is a different document and does not do this. If the same domain already serves the agentURI file, control is proven there — say which of the two you are relying on rather than leaving the endpoints unbound.
- Reputation is **client-attested**: the caller who paid posts `giveFeedback(agentId, value, valueDecimals, tag1, tag2, endpoint, feedbackURI, feedbackHash)`; the registry rejects feedback from the agent's owner and operators, so you cannot rate yourself. Values are fixed point — 99.77% uptime is `value=9977, valueDecimals=2`; 87/100 quality is `value=87, valueDecimals=0`. Read with `getSummary(agentId, clientAddresses, tag1, tag2)` and filter to clients you trust; unfiltered totals are Sybil bait.
- The spec also defines a Validation Registry (re-execution, zkML, TEE attestation, 0–100 validator scores). It is not part of the deployed pair above — check before designing on it.
- The contracts are live; the EIP is still **Draft**, so treat anything you have not verified onchain as movable. Registries are ERC-1967 proxies: read the implementation slot if a signature surprises you.

## x402 — pay per HTTP call, no accounts

`GET` → `402` + `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` → client signs → retry with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` → server verifies and settles → `200` + `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`. A facilitator (Coinbase runs a public one, anyone can run their own) performs verify/settle so the resource server never runs a node or holds gas.

Amounts go on the wire in **token base units** — the dollar figure scaled by the token's decimals. USDC has 6, so $0.10 is `100000` and $2.50 is `2500000`; never send `0.10`, and never an 18-decimal figure. Native USDC on Base is `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`; `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` is mainnet USDC and `0xd9aAEc86B65D86f6A7B5B1b0c42FFA531710b6CA` is the bridged USDbC — both are the wrong contract for a Base x402 route.

Either implementation is fine — the scoped SDKs, or your own handler posting to a facilitator's `/verify` and `/settle`. If you reach for the SDKs, the maintained TypeScript line is the scoped one: `@x402/core`, `@x402/evm`, `@x402/fetch`, `@x402/express`, with `@coinbase/x402` as the facilitator config beside it; unscoped `x402`, `x402-fetch`, `x402-express` are frozen at 1.2.0, and Go lives at `github.com/x402-foundation/x402/go/v2`. Two symbols to unlearn before you import anything: `x402Fetch` and `createWallet` do not exist in the scoped packages, and a one-argument `paymentMiddleware(config)` is the v1 shape — on 2.x the Express middleware takes routes plus a resource server, and the fetch wrapper takes an x402 client rather than a bare account. Confirm those entry points in one read of the installed `.d.ts` and get on with it; the package tree is not worth touring.

**A caller with USDC and no ETH can still pay**, because USDC implements **EIP-3009**: the client signs a `transferWithAuthorization` offchain and the server or facilitator submits it and pays the gas. That is the mechanism to name — not ERC-4337 bundlers, not an unnamed "relayer", not ERC-2612 permit followed by `transferFrom`.

## EIP-7702 — contract code on an EOA the user already has

Live on Ethereum mainnet since Pectra, **2025-05-07**. The EOA signs an authorization **with its own key** (a type `0x04` transaction) that writes a delegation designator, `0xef0100 || implementation address`, into the account. Calls to that same address then execute the implementation's code — an approve+swap batched atomically, sponsored gas, session-key auth — with the address, key, ENS name and history untouched. Deploying a fresh ERC-4337 wallet instead puts the user at a **new address**, which is what to reject whenever the existing address has to survive.

The delegation **persists**. It stays in place until a later authorization replaces it, or clears it by delegating to the zero address. It is not single-transaction-only and does not auto-revert when the batched call finishes.
